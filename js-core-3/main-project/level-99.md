# Level 99 - Ideas for further work

Here are some ideas for consideration for further work

- Truncate long summaries and provide a "... read more..." control to reveal more.
- Allow user to mark "favourite" shows
- Allow user to store notes on each episode
- Use local storage to cache the above, and perhaps also to cache episode lists
- Paginate through results with a "load more" button - don't load 100s of episodes at a time.
- Experiment with infinite scroll
- Handle errors from fetch
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility
- Style your page to fit the theme of the show (colours, typography, background images, etc). Commit to one show to do this.
- Season selector (see screenshot)
