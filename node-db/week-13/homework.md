# Homework

- Finish the tasks from the workshop
- Try adding an `/about` route to your app to serve some HTML. How is this different from using express's static middleware? You can see one way of doing it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529586/render-basic-html-view)
- Complete the nodeschool.io [learnyounode tutorial](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

**Important:** When you get stuck during the homework you should follow the following "escalation policy".

- First, search for answers on Google and Stack Overflow. If you have an error message, copy and paste it into Google.
- When you are stuck for longer than 20 minutes - no longer! - write a question to your fellow students in your class channel on slack. Take a while to think carefully about the question. This is an important skill. There is a great guide to writing good questions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- If you cannot get an answer from your fellow students, @ a mentor with your question and we will reply as soon as we can.
