This is the syllabus and course material for
[Code Your Future](http://codeyourfuture.co/), a not-for-profit volunteer-run
coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build
anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or
even a mobile app!

The six-months course contains:

* HTML/CSS
* Core JavaScript
* Backend development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* Modern front-end development with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

We’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies
