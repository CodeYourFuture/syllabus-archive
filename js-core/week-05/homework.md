# Homework
1. [The repo](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises) that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript. You should know all the needed information by now.

2. Follow [this course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) on Khan Academy. It will go through some of the basics that we covered in the class and beyond.

4. **Research:**

Read the chapter from JS: The Good parts
- Chapter 9: Style - it's a short chapter, everyone start by reading that chapter.
- ALL: Read the chapter about **Objects** (up to Reference)
- Read the chapter about **Arrays** (ignore the Methods section)
- Read the chapter about Functions up to the section about **Return**

When reading always try the code snippets by yourself in Node. (change document.writeln to console.log)

Next class - we want you to do a presentation (including showing some code sample) for one of these concepts:

- Switch Statements and Ternary Operators
- Math methods in JavaScript
- While loops (compare them to for Loops)
- Array.slice and Array.splice
- Array.map and Array.forEach
- Array.find and Array.filter
- String.replace, String.search and other String methods
- Object.keys (How to loop the properties of an object)
- [Function arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
- [Advanced] [Different ways of Creating objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Creating_new_objects)
- [Advanced] [Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Inheritance)
- [Advanced] [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)


## Prepare for the next class
1. Reserach **Unit Testing** (next time, know how to answer the question: **what is TDD?**)
