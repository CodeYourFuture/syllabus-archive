## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is used for making complex, interactive user interfaces. It has become very popular in the last 5 years.

Why has it become so popular?

- It is fast and efficient
- It is easy to understand & less verbose than "vanilla" JS api
- It helps separate functionality into small, understandable pieces

## What is a component?

React heavily relies on a concept called "components". Components are like small Lego blocks for designing and developing user interfaces. They can be stuck together in different ways to create new UI.

Let's have a look at an example: the GitHub header. What are logical "pieces" of UI? What could be a component?

Here we've highlighted some elements that could be components:

### Component tips

There are no hard & fast rules for making components. UIs can be split up into components in many different ways, requiring judgement based on your context.

- Components should follow the Single Responsibility Principle
    + Each component should only have 1 "responsibility"
    + Should only do 1 thing
- Components should have good, explicit names
    + This helps you to remember what the component's job is

> **Exercise**:
> Look at the example online shopping user interface in the [Thinking in React article](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) (the image at the top). Draw boxes around the components and give them names. Compare with the example components shown in the second image.

## Rendering with React

Remember how annoying it was to manage the DOM yourself in [week 8](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html)? The "vanilla" JavaScript apis for updating the DOM are quite long and difficult to remember. React makes this easier by instead of manipulating each DOM element itself. You give React a "description" of the DOM that you want and it will  update the DOM for you. React "abstracts" away the management of the DOM.

Let's take a look at an example. We are going to walk through how to render a `<div>` with the text "Hello World" within it.

First, lets recap how we could do this using "vanilla" JS ([interactive version](http://jsbin.com/motorexehu/edit?html,output)):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<div id="root"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var divNode = document.createElement('div');
    var textNode = document.createTextNode('Hello World');
    divNode.appendChild(textNode);

    var rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
    rootElement.appendChild(divNode);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now let's convert to using React ([interactive version](http://jsbin.com/recegadexu/edit?html,output)):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<!-- Load React & ReactDOM scripts -->
<!-- Don't worry about how we're doing this yet! -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<!-- Root element -->
<div id="root"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
    const element = React.createElement('div', {
        children: 'Hello World'
    })

    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## JSX

JSX is a simple syntax "sugar" that *looks* like HTML. It improves the developer experience writing react as it is actually converted to the `React.createElement` function when you run it.

Using JSX ([interactive version](http://jsbin.com/gekahexige/edit?html,output)):

## Let's Create A React App

The Facebook team behind React have created a tool to help you create and set up React projects. It is called [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We will use it for the rest of the module.

> **Exercise**: Install & set up a Create React App by following the steps below

```
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-hotel
cd my-hotel/
npm start
```

Notice that create-react-app has created a bunch of folders for you in the `my-hotel` directory.

## React Components

We looked at the beginning of the lesson at the concept of components. Now let's look at how components are made in React.

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello World</div>
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Components get more powerful when you combine (or "compose") several components together ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-nxhe2q)):

```js
class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <span>Hello</span>
    }
}
class Mentor extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <span>Ali</span>
    }
}

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Greeting />
                <Mentor />
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

Notice how the components that we write (`HelloWorld`, `Greeting`, `Mentor`) are `camelCased` and always start with an uppercase letter? And "regular DOM" components (`div`, `span`) are always lowercase? This the convention to let you know whether you are using a "regular DOM component" or something that you have written.

## Embedding JS into JSX

Like Handlebars, you can insert variables (and some other things) into React components. Anything that is inside curly braces (`{` and `}`) is interpreted as a regular JavaScript "expression". That means you can use every object or function from JavaScript that we have learned so far. Let's look at an example ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-byupse)):

```js
class Mentor extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald']
        return <span>{mentors.join(', ')}</span>
    }
}
```

Now we have modified the `Mentor` component to use the `Array.join` method so that it lists several mentor's names. This also works with other JS types:

```js
<span>{1 + 2 + 3}</span>
```

```js
const weather = {
    temperature: 5,
    location: 'London'
}
<p>The temperature in {weather.location} is {weather.temperature}</p>
```

```js
function formatName(user) {
    return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName
}
<span>{formatName(user)}</span>
```

A common pattern in React is to use `Array.map` to loop through a list of items and render a component for each one ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-z51fpz)):

```js
const mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald']

class Item extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <li>{this.props.name}</li>
    )
  }
}

class List extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.props.items.map((item) => (
          <Item name={item}/>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

Here we are using `Array.map` to turn an array of strings into an array of components. We are using a "real" map function, not just special syntax like `{{> each}}` from Handlebars.

An ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-cwryrk)) of separating the 2 components in the example above in 2 files.

> **Exercise**:
> Using the `my-hotel` React app that you created earlier, edit `src/App.js` to create a hotel welcome page.
> 1. Change the title to say "Welcome to CYF Hotel" and change the `img` to have `src="https://codeyourfuture.io/static/media/cyf_brand.fbcea877.png"`
> 2. Copy the content of the `header` to a new component called `Logo`
> 3. Replace the `header` with a usage of the new `Logo` component
> 4. Replace the `p` with a message saying that there are bookings available for today's date (hint `new Date().toLocaleDateString()`)
> 5. Extract the `p` to a component named `BookingsMessage`
> 6. Create a new component `SpecialDeals` and render an empty `div`
> 7. Within the `SpecialDeals` components, use an array containing some special deal strings and render each one as a `<p>` within the `div`

## Importing/Exporting Components

To help organise your code, components can be imported and exported just like any other JavaScript code ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-jnkuqk)):

```js
import Greeting from './Greeting'
import Mentor from './Mentor'

class HelloMentor extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Greeting />
                <Mentor />
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

> **Exercise**:
> Using the `my-hotel` app, edit `src/App.js` to extract the `Logo`, `BookingsMessage` and `SpecialDeals` components to new files `src/Logo.js` and `src/SpecialDeals.js`
> Hint: you will need to import React

## Making an Argument for Props

What's the problem with this component? Hint: imagine what a user story might look like for this small application. How might changes to the user story affect changes to the code?

Our components are very inflexible. They cannot say hello to other mentors, and they can only say "hello", not "hi" or "greetings". If our user stories change, for example if we wanted to say hello to a different mentor, we would have to to change the code too. This is easy in our tiny application but for "real" applications this might be more difficult.

Instead wouldn't it be good if we could change which mentor we are saying hello to every time we render the component? This is what "props" are for.

## What Are Props?

Props are what we use in React to pass "arguments" to components. They are very similar to arguments in functions - you can "pass" props to components, and you can use those props in a component.

First let's look at passing props to your components ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ketrwi?file=index.js)):

```js
<Mentor mentor="Kash" />
```

As you can see props are key-value pairs, in this example the key is `mentor` and the value is the string `'Kash'`. We don't have to use strings, we can use any valid JavaScript data like numbers, arrays and objects. Remember that in JSX you can use curly braces (`{` & `}`) to inject data that is not a string:

```js
<HotelRoom price={123}>
```

Now let's take a look at using props that we have passed to a component ([interactive example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ketrwi?file=Mentor.js)):

```js
<span>{this.props.mentor}</span>
```

React gives you access to props via the `this.props` object. We can then inject into our component using curly braces. Because `this.props` is just a regular object, you can also inject into DOM attributes:

```js
<div id={'my-id-' + this.props.id}>{this.props.content}</div>
```

> **Exercise:**
> Open the `my-hotel` React application that your created last week
> 1. Edit the `Logo` component so that the hotel name in the welcome message is passed as a prop
> 2. Edit the `SpecialDeals` component so that the array is passed as a prop
