Functions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask it to. They take an input and return an output.

Here's a function that doubles a number:

```js
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}
```

To use the function we need to:
a) _call_ it with an input and
b) assign the returned value to a variable

```js
var result = double(2);

console.log(result); // 4
```

## Exercise

* Complete the function in exercise.js so that it halves the input
* Try calling the function more than once with some different numbers

> Remember to use the return keyword to get a value out of the function

## Expected result

```
6
```

## Exercise 2

* Complete the function in exercise2.js so that it triples the input

## Expected result

```
24
```
