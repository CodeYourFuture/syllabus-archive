It is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.

We'll do this in JavaScript, using something called `console.log()`.

Inside of `exercise.js` there's a line of code that will print "Hello world!".

### 1. Run the program

* Open a terminal window
* Change directory to this folder (`cd week-1/C-hello-world`)
* Run the program using node (`node exercise.js`)

### 2. Experiment

* Try to `console.log()` something different. For example, 'Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!'.
* Try to console.log() several things at once.
* What happens when you get rid of the quote marks?
* What happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?
