1. For each reviewer you have been assigned:

   1. Click `Invite a collaborator`
   1. Type the github username of the reviewer, and select them
   1. Click `Add <username> to tv-show-dom-project`

### Make a PR and request review

1. Make a PR from `master` to your `for-review` branch.
1. Click the settings cog-wheel next to Reviewers
1. For each reviewer you have been assigned
   1. enter the reviewer's username and select them
   1. DM your reviewer on slack to say that your code is ready for review
