# Level 40 - Add a Show Selector

For this level you will have to have learned to use fetch() to `GET` JSON content from an API.

1. Complete all requirements from level 30
1. Add a `select` input which allows you to choose which show you are interested in
   1. The select should list shows in alphabetical order, case-insensitive
   1. When a show is selected, your app should display the episodes for that show as per the earlier levels
   1. You can get the list of shows by loading `shows.js` in your `index.html` and using the provided function: `getAllShows()`
   1. Ensure that your search and episode selector controls still work correctly when you switch shows.

### Example screenshots of Show Selector

Note: Provided your project meets the above requirements, it can **look** however you want.

Here is one example layout.
