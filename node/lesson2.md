# Node II

### It's our second week of Node.js! The plan is as follows:

## 10:30 AM - Homework review

## 11:00 AM - Scrum session with Kram

## 1:00 PM - Node session

This is going to be a mixture of instructor-led parts to recap the fundamentals of Node.js, and practical pair-programming parts to get more experience with building Node.js apps.
